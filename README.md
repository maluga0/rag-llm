This is an example of a Retrival Augmented GenAI model for German language PDFs

As a model I used DRXD1000/Phoenix LLM which is a trained mistral model and possibly the best German speaking model out there. I used LlamaCpp to run the model locally on my Macbook M1 for which I needed a GGUF version of the model.
